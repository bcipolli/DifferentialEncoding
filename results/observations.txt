asymmetric-asymmetric vs:
  * symmetric-asymmetric:  slowest; least input variation, most  output variation... least IH dependence 
  * symmetric-symmetric:   medium;  least input varaition, least output variation...  least IH dependence
[ * asymmetric-asymmetric: medium;  most  input variation; most  output variation...  most IH dependence
  * asymmetric-symmetric:  fastest; most  input variation,  least output variation... 2nd most IH dependence

when trained without cc connections:
* asymmmetric_*_n2 vs asymmetric_*_n0 shows significantly slower learning for _n0
* symmmetric_*_n2  vs  symmetric_*_n0 similar learning for _n0
these suggest that more input variation (asymmetric_*) makes for better classification and therefore interhemispheric transfer is beneficial in learning.  The output variation is not really relevant in the speed of learning.
 
so... this tells us why we want asymmetric inputs--it makes output classification go faster... but at the cost of more IH dependence.  NICE! :D

want to show that with limited resources, we will become more asymmetric in processing.  but can't have asymmetric inputs, right?  well... could compare across  models with same inputs & differing resources... or could give symmetric inputs and look at asymmetry index.  Both would be useful!

=================

Low resources:
asymmetric-asymmetric vs:
  * symmetric-asymmetric:  slowest; least input variation, most  output variation... least IH dependence / essentially flat
  * symmetric-symmetric:   medium;  least input varaition, least output variation...  least IH dependence / a bit of asymmetry (even in noise case)
[ * asymmetric-asymmetric: medium;  most  input variation; most  output variation...  most IH dependence / asymmetry (even in noise case)
  * asymmetric-symmetric:  fastest; most  input variation,  least output variation... most IH dependence / asymmetry (not in noise case)

* asymmetric_*_n2 vs symmetric_*_n2 shows a big advantage in amount learned
* *_asymmetric_n2 vs *_symmetric_n2 shows a slight advantage in amount learned
 
NOTE: need to compare "asymmetry index" by doing full resource vs low resource, for lesion curves.
NOTE: try testing idea of white matter differences, rather than grey matter differences, for "low resource"
  * either force them to be symmetric during training (introduce a matrix for weight coupling, and updates should be average of coupled weights)
  ****** do this via pruning!
  
NEW IDEA: implement pruning in the CC
  
NOTE: implement homeostatic mechanisms?

=================

how to measure asymmetry?
* cut CC, compare LH vs RH 


So, to test:
* decreasing resources
* test nonoise vs noise (all of these patterns can be solved without interhemispheric collaboration)
* test no cc conns vs 2
* come up with l/r pairings that would encourage asymmetry

note: why is this easier than the ringo stuff?
  
so... interhemispheric patterns require different outputs on inputs
  intrahemispheric patterns show no such confusion
  
we want asymmetric-symmetric:
